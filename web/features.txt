IMPORTANT NOTES

FOR DEVELOPMENT:
- For future bookings (not on the same day), do not filter if washer is_on_shift=True

- If Registered Customer did not declare vehicle during booking, create a dummy vehicle 
  then add feature to edit vehicle info or replace it with an existing vehicle under that customer.

- If Appointment completed before ETA, update the appointment's end_time and then adjust the start_time of walk-in customers
- If Appointment cancelled, 
    - adjust the start_time of the next appointment (priority based) if customers are already in the shop
    - adjust the start_time of the next appointment (priority based) if customers are not yet in the shop, notify them
    - if no next appointments were adjusted, open the slot for new bookings.

- Add a column to record who booked the appointment is walk-in.

DIFFICULT SCENARIOS

- When there are 2 washers having the same shift, and washer #1 is currently booked to wash a bike, then there's a new appointment to wash an SUV.
  2 washers are required to wash an SUV, so customer will wait for washer #1 to finish current job with the bike before starting to wash the SUV.
  Risk: Washer #2 is stand by. Long waiting time.

- When there are 2 washers having the same shift, and washer #1 is currently booked to wash a bike, then there's a new appointment to wash an SUV.
  2 washers are required to wash an SUV. However, washer #1 will end shift after current job. 
  So, customer will wait until another washer (#3) clocks in before starting to wash the SUV.
  Risk: Washer #2 is stand by. Long waiting time.

- How to verify vehicle type? Customers might book for Sedan but bring an SUV. 
  Same goes to Motorcycles, how do we categorize them as Small Bike or Big Bike.
  Risk: If overlooked, price will be cheaper.
